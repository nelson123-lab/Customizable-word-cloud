# word-cloud

A word cloud, also known as a tag cloud, is a visual representation of the most frequently used words in a given text or set of texts. The words are typically displayed in different sizes and font weights, with the most frequently used words being displayed in the largest font size. The goal of a word cloud is to quickly identify the most important or relevant words in a text, and it is often used as a way to summarize or analyze large amounts of text data. Word clouds can be created using various online tools or software programs.

Web scrapping is used here for generating word cloud. Web scraping is a technique for extracting information from websites. It can be used to gather the text data from a website, which can then be analyzed and used to create a word cloud.

Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes or to the roots of words known as "lemmas". Stemming is important in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP).
